As the size and complexity of data generated from such experiments grows, so does the requirement for standard data formats. To address these needs, the Functional Genomics Experiment [Object Model / Markup-Language] (FuGE-OM, FuGE-ML) has been created to facilitate the development of data standards.FuGE is a model of the shared components in different functional genomics domains. FuGE facilitates the development of data standards in functional genomics in two ways:\r\n1. FuGE provides a model of common components in functional genomics investigations, such as materials, data, protocols, equipment and software. These models can be extended to develop modular data formats with consistent structure.\r\n2. FuGE provides a framework for capturing complete laboratory workflows, enabling the integration of pre-existing data formats. In this context, FuGE allows the capture of additional metadata that gives formats a context within the complete workflow. FuGE is available as a UML model and an XML Schema",

Therefore the PSI, with full participation by ISB, has developed a new format by taking the best aspects of each of the precursor formats to form a single one.

However, the complexity of the MAGE-ML format has made its use impractical for laboratories lacking dedicated bioinformatics support. We propose a simple tab-delimited, spreadsheet-based format, MAGE-TAB, which will become a part of the MAGE microarray data standard and can be used for annotating and communicating microarray data in a MIAME compliant fashion. MAGE-TAB will enable laboratories without bioinformatics experience or support to manage, exchange and submit well-annotated microarray data in a standard format using a spreadsheet. The MAGE-TAB format is self-contained, and does not require an understanding of MAGE-ML or XML",

It has now been integrated into the VIVO-ISF Ontology, which leverages and expands upon both the eagle-i and VIVO ontologies to create a semantic framework that describes not only scientific resources but research activities and clinical activities.",

It has now been integrated into the VIVO-ISF Ontology, which leverages and expands upon both the eagle-i and VIVO ontologies to create a semantic framework that describes not only scientific resources but research activities and clinical activities.",

GBIF.org makes the data discoverable and citable, assigning each download a DOI and storing it for an extended period of time. More than 1 peer-reviewed research publication citing GBIF as a source of data is published every day, in studies spanning the impacts of climate change, the spread of pests and diseases, priority areas for conservation and food security. To share your data with GBIF follow this quick guide: http://www.gbif.org/publishing-data/quick-guide To deposit/host your data, it is recommended you use one of the trusted IPT data hosting centres (DHC) listed in FAIRsharing.org. The DHC will provide you with an account on their IPT, which will allow you to manage your own datasets and publish them through GBIF.org.",

In addition, each dataset is assigned a DOI that allows reference and tracking of the data. The data become publicly available in the database only after the corresponding article has been peer-reviewed and published in a journal.\r\n\r\nThe STRENDA Commission, comprising an international panel of highly-regarded scientists who have wide-ranging expertise in areas such as biochemistry, enzyme nomenclature, bioinformatics, systems biology, modelling, mechanistic enzymology and theoretical biology, has established standards for data reporting in enzymology research. The aim of these STRENDA Guidelines is to improve the quality of data published in the scientific literature and to enable researchers to compare, evaluate, interpret and reproduce experimental research results published in the literature and databases.

Links are also provided to related data stored in other thematic repositories (e.g., soil metabarcoding data) where appropriate. It was built to meet the needs of the ecosystem science, tertiary education, natural resource management industry and government sectors. AEKOS has four key services: self-service data submission (SHaRED - http://www.shared.org.au/) with DOIs for provenance, versioning and citations for uploading scientific datasets, Integrated Site Data (ISD) upload, access and intelligible reuse via its portal (http://www.aekos.org.au/) and a visualisation of TERN AusPlots plant survey data (Soils-to-Satellites - http://www.soils2satellites.org.au/). ISD upload service involves specialist ecological knowledge modelling of data that’s mapped to the AEKOS ontological, ‘methods description’ and trait information models. Unlike self-service data submission, this service enables users to view the actual observations and measurements contained within data files - it maximises transparency. AEKOS is in the pipeline for Thomson & Reuters Data Citation Index with expected release in August 2016. There are currently 96,657 sites for mostly plants and their environmental data observed using 233,556 ‘plots’. Animal site data is growing with a 20-year plus ongoing desert monitoring program on plants and animals (13 sites with 25 plots) and an inventory survey of the globally unique platypus (277 sites with 2,134 plots). Regular updates for ongoing datasets occur quarterly.  Responsive user support for SHaRED and AEKOS data download is available.",

The CONSORT (CONsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) 2010 guideline is intended to improve the reporting of parallel-group randomized controlled trial (RCT), enabling readers to understand a trial's design, conduct, analysis and interpretation, and to assess the validity of its results. This can only be achieved through complete adherence and transparency by authors.\r\n\r\nCONSORT 2010 was developed through collaboration and consensus between clinical trial methodologists, guideline developers, knowledge translation specialists, and journal editors (see CONSORT group ). CONSORT 2010 is the current version of the guideline and supersedes the 2001 and 1996 versions . It contains a 25-item checklist and flow diagram",

Rather, GBIF indexes thousands of datasets shared freely by hundreds of institutions worldwide making it the biggest biodiversity database on the Internet. GBIF.org makes the data discoverable and citable, assigning each download a DOI and storing it for an extended period of time. More than 1 peer-reviewed research publication citing GBIF as a source of data is published every day, in studies spanning the impacts of climate change, the spread of pests and diseases, priority areas for conservation and food security. To share your data with GBIF follow this quick guide: http://www.gbif.org/publishing-data/quick-guide To deposit/host your data, it is recommended you use one of the trusted IPT data hosting centres (DHC) listed in FAIRsharing.org. The DHC will provide you with an account on their IPT, which will allow you to manage your own datasets and publish them through GBIF.org.",

In addition, each dataset is assigned a DOI that allows reference and tracking of the data. The data become publicly available in the database only after the corresponding article has been peer-reviewed and published in a journal.\r\n\r\nThe STRENDA Commission, comprising an international panel of highly-regarded scientists who have wide-ranging expertise in areas such as biochemistry, enzyme nomenclature, bioinformatics, systems biology, modelling, mechanistic enzymology and theoretical biology, has established standards for data reporting in enzymology research. The aim of these STRENDA Guidelines is to improve the quality of data published in the scientific literature and to enable researchers to compare, evaluate, interpret and reproduce experimental research results published in the literature and databases.

Links are also provided to related data stored in other thematic repositories (e.g., soil metabarcoding data) where appropriate. It was built to meet the needs of the ecosystem science, tertiary education, natural resource management industry and government sectors. AEKOS has four key services: self-service data submission (SHaRED - http://www.shared.org.au/) with DOIs for provenance, versioning and citations for uploading scientific datasets, Integrated Site Data (ISD) upload, access and intelligible reuse via its portal (http://www.aekos.org.au/) and a visualisation of TERN AusPlots plant survey data (Soils-to-Satellites - http://www.soils2satellites.org.au/). ISD upload service involves specialist ecological knowledge modelling of data that’s mapped to the AEKOS ontological, ‘methods description’ and trait information models. Unlike self-service data submission, this service enables users to view the actual observations and measurements contained within data files - it maximises transparency. AEKOS is in the pipeline for Thomson & Reuters Data Citation Index with expected release in August 2016. There are currently 96,657 sites for mostly plants and their environmental data observed using 233,556 ‘plots’. Animal site data is growing with a 20-year plus ongoing desert monitoring program on plants and animals (13 sites with 25 plots) and an inventory survey of the globally unique platypus (277 sites with 2,134 plots). Regular updates for ongoing datasets occur quarterly.  Responsive user support for SHaRED and AEKOS data download is available.",

TCRD contains information about human targets, with special emphasis on four families of targets that are central to the NIH IDG initiative: GPCRs, kinases, ion channels and nuclear receptors. Olfactory GPCRs (oGPCRs) are treated as a separate family. A key aim of the KMC is to classify the development/druggability level of targets. The official public portal for TCRD is Pharos (pharos.nih.gov). Based on modern web design principles the Pharos interface provides facile access to all data types collected by the KMC. Given the complexity of the data surrounding any target, efficient and intuitive visualization has been a high priority, to enable users to quickly navigate & summarize search results and rapidly identify patterns. A critical feature of the interface is the ability to perform flexible search and subsequent drill down of search results. Underlying the interface is a RESTful API that provides programmatic access to all KMC data, allowing for easy consumption in user applications.",

For detailed information on all PSI activities, please see PSI Home Page. The PSI-PAR format is a standardized means of representing protein affinity reagent data and is designed to facilitate the exchange of information between different databases and/or LIMS systems. PSI-PAR is not a proposed database structure. The PSI-PAR format consists of the PSI-MI XML2.5 schema (originally designed for molecular interactions) and the PSI-PAR controlled vocabulary. In addition, PSI-PAR documentation and examples are available on this web page. The scope of PSI-PAR is PAR and target protein production and characterization.",

We offer user-submission tools and have strong reporting capabilities. We will utilise and further develop de-facto standard formats where various components are encapsulated, such as the encoded spectral and chromatographic data, and associated information about the chemical structure, as well as metadata describing assays and the study as a whole. We are dedicated to collaborate closely with major parties in world-wide metabolomics communities, such as the Metabolomics Society and the associated Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI).",

The source of the terms are multiple: they include vocabulary and definitions in chapter 12 of the IUPAC nomenclature book, instrument and software vendors and developers and other user-submitted terms. Although its structure and use is linked to mzML, mzIdentML and mzQuantML, it is dynamically maintained in a OBO format. The PSI-Mass Spectrometry (MS) CV contains all the terms used in the PSI MS–related data standards. The CV contains a logical hierarchical structure to ensure ease of maintenance and the development of software that makes use of complex semantics. The CV contains terms required for a complete description of an MS analysis pipeline used in proteomics, including sample labeling, digestion enzymes, instrumentation parts and parameters, software used for identification and quantification of peptides/proteins and the parameters and scores used to determine their significance. Owing to the range of topics covered by the CV, collaborative development across several PSI working groups, including proteomics research groups, instrument manufacturers and software vendors, was necessary.

However, the complexity of the MAGE-ML format has made its use impractical for laboratories lacking dedicated bioinformatics support. We propose a simple tab-delimited, spreadsheet-based format, MAGE-TAB, which will become a part of the MAGE microarray data standard and can be used for annotating and communicating microarray data in a MIAME compliant fashion. MAGE-TAB will enable laboratories without bioinformatics experience or support to manage, exchange and submit well-annotated microarray data in a standard format using a spreadsheet. The MAGE-TAB format is self-contained, and does not require an understanding of MAGE-ML or XML",

The ontology pulls together classes from reference ontologies such as disease, cell line, cell type and anatomy and adds axiomatisation as necessary to connect areas such as disease to phenotype. ",

It was recognized that the existence of two separate formats for essentially the same thing generated confusion and required extra programming effort. Therefore the PSI, with full participation by ISB, has developed a new format by taking the best aspects of each of the precursor formats to form a single one. It is intended to replace the previous two formats. This new format was originally given a working name of dataXML. The final name is mzML.",

Many next-generation sequencing and analysis tools work with SAM/BAM. For custom track display, the main advantage of indexed BAM over PSL and other human-readable alignment formats is that only the portions of the files needed to display a particular region are transferred to UCSC. This makes it possible to display alignments from files that are so large that the connection to UCSC would time out when attempting to upload the whole file to UCSC. Both the BAM file and its associated index file remain on your web-accessible server (http, https, or ftp), not on the UCSC server. UCSC temporarily caches the accessed portions of the files to speed up interactive display.",

It was recognized that the existence of two separate formats for essentially the same thing generated confusion and required extra programming effort. Therefore the PSI, with full participation by ISB, has developed a new format by taking the best aspects of each of the precursor formats to form a single one. It is intended to replace the previous two formats. This new format was originally given a working name of dataXML. The final name is mzML.",

LSDBs are curated by experts on their respective loci, and as such are typically the best resources of such information available. But LSDBs vary widely in format and completeness, making data integration and exchange among them difficult and time-consuming. To address these difficulties, the VarioML format has been developed for the full range of variation data use-cases, providing semantically well-defined components which can be easily composed to fit specific needs.\r\n\r\nUsing VarioML, data owners can now efficiently enable the integration, federation, and exchange of their variant data. The discoverabiliaty, extensibility, and quality of variation data is immediately enhanced. Critical new avenues of research and knowledge discovery are opened, as data using the VarioML standard can be integrated with the global library of purely genetic data.\r\n\r\nVarioML is a central prerequisite for effective modelling of phenotype data and genotype-to-phenotype relationships. It removes the long-standing technical obstacles to the effective passing of variant data from discovery laboratories into the biomedical database world. Now all that is needed is the broad participation of the genotype-to-phenotype research community.",

Although the file was used by many imaging software projects, the lack of adequate information on orientation obliged some, most notably spm, to include, for every analyzed file, an accompanying file describing the orientation, such as a file with extension .mat.",

It defines the formats for medical images that can be exchanged with the data and quality necessary for clinical use. DICOM is implemented in almost every radiology, cardiology imaging, and radiotherapy device (X-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound, etc.), and increasingly in devices in other medical domains such as ophthalmology and dentistry. With tens of thousands of imaging devices in use, DICOM is one of the most widely deployed healthcare messaging standards in the world. There are literally billions of DICOM images currently in use for clinical care. Since its first publication in 1993, DICOM has revolutionized the practice of radiology, allowing the replacement of X-ray film with a fully digital workflow. Much as the Internet has become the platform for new consumer information applications, DICOM has enabled advanced medical imaging applications that have “changed the face of clinical medicine”. From the emergency department, to cardiac stress testing, to breast cancer detection, DICOM is the standard that makes medical imaging work — for doctors and for patients.",

It defines the formats for medical images that can be exchanged with the data and quality necessary for clinical use. DICOM is implemented in almost every radiology, cardiology imaging, and radiotherapy device (X-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound, etc.), and increasingly in devices in other medical domains such as ophthalmology and dentistry. With tens of thousands of imaging devices in use, DICOM is one of the most widely deployed healthcare messaging standards in the world. There are literally billions of DICOM images currently in use for clinical care. Since its first publication in 1993, DICOM has revolutionized the practice of radiology, allowing the replacement of X-ray film with a fully digital workflow. Much as the Internet has become the platform for new consumer information applications, DICOM has enabled advanced medical imaging applications that have “changed the face of clinical medicine”. From the emergency department, to cardiac stress testing, to breast cancer detection, DICOM is the standard that makes medical imaging work — for doctors and for patients.",

This document defines an abstract syntax (a data model) which serves to link all RDF-based languages and specifications. The abstract syntax has two key data structures: RDF graphs are sets of subject-predicate-object triples, where the elements may be IRIs, blank nodes, or datatyped literals. They are used to express descriptions of resources. RDF datasets are used to organize collections of RDF graphs, and comprise a default graph and zero or more named graphs. RDF 1.1 Concepts and Abstract Syntax also introduces key concepts and terminology, and discusses datatyping and the handling of fragment identifiers in IRIs within RDF graphs.",

The availability of this organized information provides a more complete picture of what is currently known about moonlighting proteins. The database will also aid researchers in other fields, including determining the functions of genes identified in genome sequencing projects, interpreting data from proteomics projects and annotating protein sequence and structural databases. In addition, information about the structures and functions of moonlighting proteins can be helpful in understanding how novel protein functional sites evolved on an ancient protein scaffold, which can also help in the design of proteins with novel functions.\r\n",

Moreover, Proteome-pI facilitates statistical comparisons of the various prediction methods as well as biological investigation of protein isoelectric point space in all kingdoms of life (http://isoelectricpointdb.org/statistics.html).\r\n\r\nThe database includes various statistics and tools for interactive browsing, searching and sorting. It can be searched and browsed by organism name, average isoelectric point, molecular weight or amino acid frequencies. Proteins with extreme pI values are also available. For individual proteomes, users can retrieve proteins of interest given the method, isoelectric point and molecular weight ranges (this particular feature can be highly useful to limit potential targets in analysis of 2DPAGE gels or before conducting mass spectrometry). Finally, some general statistics (total number of proteins, amino acids, average sequence length, amino acid and di-amino acid frequencies) and datasets corresponding to major protein databases such as UniProtKB/TrEMBL and the NCBI non-redundant (nr) database have also been precalculated.",

TCRD contains information about human targets, with special emphasis on four families of targets that are central to the NIH IDG initiative: GPCRs, kinases, ion channels and nuclear receptors. Olfactory GPCRs (oGPCRs) are treated as a separate family. A key aim of the KMC is to classify the development/druggability level of targets. The official public portal for TCRD is Pharos (pharos.nih.gov). Based on modern web design principles the Pharos interface provides facile access to all data types collected by the KMC. Given the complexity of the data surrounding any target, efficient and intuitive visualization has been a high priority, to enable users to quickly navigate & summarize search results and rapidly identify patterns. A critical feature of the interface is the ability to perform flexible search and subsequent drill down of search results. Underlying the interface is a RESTful API that provides programmatic access to all KMC data, allowing for easy consumption in user applications.",

As part of this effort, IDOMAL has been developed and it is continually being updated.",

The Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) is a public repository for electron microscopy density maps of macromolecular complexes and subcellular structures. It covers a variety of techniques, including single-particle analysis, electron tomography, and electron (2D) crystallography.\r\n\r\nThe EMDB was founded at EBI in 2002, under the leadership of Kim Henrick. Since 2007 it has been operated jointly by the PDBe, and the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB PDB) as a part of EMDataBank which is funded by a joint NIH grant to PDBe, the RCSB and the National Center for Macromolecular Imaging (NCMI).",

Previously considered rare, ASD are now recognized to occur in more than 1% of children, causing immense suffering to individuals and their families. The complexity and heterogeneity of ASD make it necessary to obtain large-scale samples which are difficult to attain in any individual lab. In response, the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) provides previously collected resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) datasets from 539 individuals with ASD and 573 typical controls for the purpose of data sharing in the broader scientific community. This grass-root initiative involved 16 international sites, sharing 20 samples yielding 1112 datasets composed of both MRI data and an extensive array of phenotypic information common across nearly all sites (see below). This unprecedented effort is expected to facilitate discovery science and comparisons across samples. In accordance with HIPAA guidelines and 1000 Functional Connectomes Project / INDI protocols, all datasets are anonymous, with no protected health information included.",

The platform provides either a target-centric workflow to identify diseases that may be associated with a specific target, or a disease-centric workflow to identify targets that may be associated with a specific disease.

It defines the formats for medical images that can be exchanged with the data and quality necessary for clinical use. DICOM is implemented in almost every radiology, cardiology imaging, and radiotherapy device (X-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound, etc.), and increasingly in devices in other medical domains such as ophthalmology and dentistry. With tens of thousands of imaging devices in use, DICOM is one of the most widely deployed healthcare messaging standards in the world. There are literally billions of DICOM images currently in use for clinical care. Since its first publication in 1993, DICOM has revolutionized the practice of radiology, allowing the replacement of X-ray film with a fully digital workflow. Much as the Internet has become the platform for new consumer information applications, DICOM has enabled advanced medical imaging applications that have “changed the face of clinical medicine”. From the emergency department, to cardiac stress testing, to breast cancer detection, DICOM is the standard that makes medical imaging work — for doctors and for patients.",

Although the file was used by many imaging software projects, the lack of adequate information on orientation obliged some, most notably spm, to include, for every analyzed file, an accompanying file describing the orientation, such as a file with extension .mat.",

Links are also provided to related data stored in other thematic repositories (e.g., soil metabarcoding data) where appropriate. It was built to meet the needs of the ecosystem science, tertiary education, natural resource management industry and government sectors. AEKOS has four key services: self-service data submission (SHaRED - http://www.shared.org.au/) with DOIs for provenance, versioning and citations for uploading scientific datasets, Integrated Site Data (ISD) upload, access and intelligible reuse via its portal (http://www.aekos.org.au/) and a visualisation of TERN AusPlots plant survey data (Soils-to-Satellites - http://www.soils2satellites.org.au/). ISD upload service involves specialist ecological knowledge modelling of data that’s mapped to the AEKOS ontological, ‘methods description’ and trait information models. Unlike self-service data submission, this service enables users to view the actual observations and measurements contained within data files - it maximises transparency. AEKOS is in the pipeline for Thomson & Reuters Data Citation Index with expected release in August 2016. There are currently 96,657 sites for mostly plants and their environmental data observed using 233,556 ‘plots’. Animal site data is growing with a 20-year plus ongoing desert monitoring program on plants and animals (13 sites with 25 plots) and an inventory survey of the globally unique platypus (277 sites with 2,134 plots). Regular updates for ongoing datasets occur quarterly.  Responsive user support for SHaRED and AEKOS data download is available.",

The Archive makes it easier for many people to search datasets by metadata (description of datasets) in a unified format, and to access and download the datasets with clear terms of use (see here for detailed descriptions).\r\nIn addition, the Archive provides datasets in forms friendly to different types of users in public and private institutions, and thereby supports further contribution of each research to life science.",

MorphoBank invites scientists producing peer-reviewed research  to upload images and affiliate data with those images (labels, species names, etc.).  MorphoBank also offers a platform for live collaboration on phylgoenetic matrices by teams in a private workspace where they can also affiliate images with phylogenetic matrices.\r\n\r\nMorphoBank stores digital versions of both text and image-based observations on phenotypes.  Phylogenetic matrices (Nexus or TNT format), particularly phenotypical matrices, 2D (including JPEG, GIF, PNG, TIFF and Photoshop) and 3D (PLY, STL, ZIP, TIFF and DCM) image data and video (MPEG-4, QuickTime and WindowsMedia).  MorphoBank also offer a Documents folder for additional files about their research such as pdfs, word documents, and text files (e.g., morphometric data, phylogenetic trees).",
